Dataset: The dataset consist of short conversation passages (of 3 to 5 utterances each), each
labelled with an emotion.
- Task: The original task on this dataset was to generate responses in the dialogue that respect
the target emotion, but the dataset could also be used for sentiment analysis: i.e. to identify the
emotion associated with each utterance in the dialogue.
- Hints and suggestions: You could apply various classifiers for the sentiment analysis task
including Transformer based models like BERT. Does knowing the previous (or subsequent)
utterance improve the classifier performance? Note also that we will demonstrate text
generation techniques in the latter practical sessions of the course.
